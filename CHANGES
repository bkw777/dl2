 Expanded bootstrap function to support arbitrary files and a veriety of bundled dos installers
 Included bootstrap files:
 TEENY.100 TEENY.200 TEENY.NEC
 DSKMGR.100 DSKMGR.200 DSKMGR.K85 DSKMGR.M10

 Changed the syntax for "-b". The new syntax is:
  dl -b=filename
 where "filename" may be any of the included bootstrap files without leading path, or any arbitrary filename with leading path.
  "-h" includes a listing of all available included bootstrap files
  "-b" with no "=filename" defaults to TEENY.100
  "-b" also accepts a full or relative path to any arbitrary file, not limited to a TPDD client installer.
 Examples:
  dl -b
  dl -b=TS-DOS.NEC
  dl -b=~/Downloads/XPTERM.100
  dl -b=~/Documents/TRS-80/M100SIG/Lib-03-TELCOM/XMDPW5.100
  dl -b=./rxcini.DO

 No loader-specific code in dl.c any more (prompts & directions specific to a particular TPDD client for a particular platform).
 Each bootstrap file has it's own external files for the pre-install and post-install directions, as well as the loader file itself.

 See /usr/local/share/doc/dl for the full manuals for TEENY and DSKMGR.
