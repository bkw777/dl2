Disk Power for KC-85

Excerpt, more info here:
http://tandy.wiki/TPDD_client:Disk_Power:KC-85

Disk Power requires both INSTAL.CO and the distribution disk to install.

Here, INSTAL.CO has been repackaged into a BASIC loader which can be
bootstrapped over a serial cable, and the disk has been imaged with
pdd.sh so that dl2 can act as a virtual drive for sector access to it.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation: Just run the following command:

 $ dl -vb Disk_Power.K85 && dl -vue -m 1 -i Disk_Power.K85.pdd1

(dl2 will get both files from /usr/local/lib/dl)

When the installer on the KC-85 prompts to insert the disk, just hit [Enter].

Usage:

+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| DISK | NewDsk |  Load  |  ALL   | RAMDIR |  Kill  |  List  | Format |  Menu  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| RAM  | ClrBAS |  Save  |  ALL   | DSKDIR |  Kill  |  List  | ClrPST |  Menu  |
+------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
       |   F1   |   F2   |   F3   |   F4   |   F5   |   F6   |   F7   |   F8   |
       +--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+

The top row are DISK operations which apply while in DISK view mode.
The bottom row are RAM operations which apply while in RAM view mode.

DISK Operations:

  F1 - NewDsk - (re)-Read the (changed) disk directory.

  F2 - Load - Load a file from DISK to RAM.

  F3 - ALL - TODO/FIXME: I don't remember now, select all probably?

  F4 - RAMDIR - Switch to RAM View Mode

  F5 - Kill - Delete a file from the DISK.

  F6 - List - TODO/FIXME: I don't remember.

  F7 - Format - Format the disk. (note1)

  F8 - Menu - Exit out of Disk-Power back to the KC-85 main menu.

RAM Operations:

  F1 - ClrBAS - Clear the BASIC program area to recover ram for loading files.

  F2 - Save - Save a file from RAM to DISK.

  F3 - ALL - TODO/FIXME: I don't remember now, select all probably?

  F4 - DSKDIR - Switch to DISK View Mode. (note1)

  F5 - Kill - Delete a file from RAM.

  F6 - List - TODO/FIXME: I don't remember.

  F7 - ClrPST - Clear the PASTE buffer area to recover ram for loading files.

  F8 - Menu - Exit out of Disk-Power back to the KC-85 main menu.


(note1) F4 Disk / F7 Format quirk:

  F4 will not enter DISK view unless there is a valid formatted disk
  inserted to read.

  The F7 Format Disk function...
  needed to create a formatted disk...
  is in the DISK menu...
  which requires a formatted disk to access...

  This means that it's not possible to format a new blank disk unless you
  already have at least one other already-formatted disk available, just
  to put in the drive first, just so that you can access the DISK
  functions at all, where the Format function is.

  Once in DISK view mode, then you can swap in another disk and press
  F7 to format it.

  Presumably the user was expected to always have the distribution disk
  available if nothing else, because the software required the original
  distribution disk to install or re-install after a crash. There was no
  way to back up either the installed program or the whole original disk.
  So, since crashes can happen at any time, you needed to carry the
  actual distribution disk around with the computer at all times.
  And so you could always use that to access the DISK menu if nothing else.

  In reality, today you can just use another TPDD client like DSKMGR on the
  KC-85, or pdd.sh on a PC. This is only a theoretical limitation if it were
  1985, you were away from home, and had only your not-crashed KC-85 with
  Disk-Power already installed, and a new disk.
