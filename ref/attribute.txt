Always "F" for any KC-85 platform clients.

This "F" is really just a convention of "Floppy", the original client for
Model 100 & 200 that shipped with the TPDD, and subsequently other KC-85
platform clients that wanted to be fully compatible with Floppy. (TS-DOS, etc)

The field is just a single letter simple text search field into which a client
may write any single letter, and later select files by that letter.

The only effect it has is the order that filenames are returned by the drive.
Matching files, if any, are returned first. That's it. As a client you can ask
the drive "give me the E files" and stop doing get-next once you get a non-E.

Floppy always writes "F" for every file. And since the other KC-85 platform
clients wanted to be as compatible as possible, some or all of those do too.

Because of that, when a real drive reads a disk with files created by Floppy
or TS-DOS etc, every file on the disk will have an F.

And so we basically lie and say that we read an F off the disk for every file.

However there are other clients and other platforms that could possibly use
this field for real.

The most technically correct, client-agnostic, faithful drive emulating way
to handle this field would be to save whatever a client supplies when a client
creates a file, and reproduce that later when a client asks for file listings,
(And perform the same directory list re-ordering that the drive firmware does.
 Just make 2 passes through the directory table, once returning the matches,
 then the rest.), and only fabricate data based on a configurable user setting,
 and when there is no actual data previously saved from a client.
 IE, a "tandy compat" config option to supply F (or other) by default.
