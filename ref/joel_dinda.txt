Some good TPDD info from Joel Dinda in 1997
https://dillernet.com/m100/docs/pdd2-sector-0.html

It's not complete or all correct but it has a few things that aren't elsewhere:

* The sectors-in-use counter at Sector 0 Byte 1260 does not include the directory sector.
  [BKW: Is this true? There is something funny about that field, maybe this is it.]

* My Tandy Utilities disk has CHR$(255) at byte 1280 in Sector 0.
  Note that this means EOF in any other sector, wonder if it means something similar here.
  No copy I've made of the disk has that.
  The Powr-DOS source disk has what appears to be a machine language routine beginning at the same location.
  Naturally it doesn't copy either.
  No other disk in my collection has ANYTHING beyond 1260 in that sector.

* The directory is stored in alpha order and has no intermediate blank entries.
  Deleting or adding a file moves everything around.
  It appears that the TDD's built-in software cares what order the directory's in, as it stops reading the directory when it finds an out-of-order filename.
