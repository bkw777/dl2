Special support for the TS-DOS button in Ultimate ROM II

A few "magic" filenames that have the following behavior/properties:

* Name: DOS100.CO, DOS200.CO, DOSNEC.CO

* If client tries to open(read), and file doesn't exist in cwd, silently
  succeed and supply contents from the same file from share root instead.

* Do not include in directory listing unless it actually exists in cwd.

* Do not supply substitute contents if file actually exists in cwd.
  Ff client tries to load a file that actually exists in cwd,
  it should work as normal, not sustitute the contents from some other file.

* Do not apply to open(write) or append. If client tries to save a file,
  it should work as normal, not overwite the copy in the share root!

* DO allow overwriting the share root copy if the client is actually in
  the share root dir.

* Don't even look if not in "floppy compat" mode (dot_offset=6).
  There is no UR-II for CP/M or WP-2 or any other kind of client,
  it's an option ROM for KC-85 platform clones only.

Explaination

UR-II has a "TS-DOS" button that tries to load a file named "DOS100.CO" on
the fly.

(or DOS200.CO for TANDY Model 200, or DOSNEC.CO for NEC PC-8201/PC-8300)

UR-II does not know about directories, and does not do anything to try
to cd to the root dir before trying to open the file.

On a real drive, this works fine. If a disk simply contains a copy of
the file, then the open() works and so the TS-DOS button works.

On an emulated drive that can cd into sub-directories, it's possible for
the user to launch TS-DOS, cd into a sub-directory that does not contain
a copy of DOS100.CO, and then exit TS-DOS (without cd-ing back up to the
root dir before exiting).

In that case, all else being equal, the TS-DOS button in UR-II would
not work any more unless/until you re-start the server.

The next time the user tries to use the TS-DOS button, UR-II tries
to load "DOS100.CO", no such file exists (in the current dir), the
open() fails, and the user can never get back into TS-DOS again. They
can't cd back to root to fix it, since they can't launch TS-DOS to do
the cd. You have to re-start the server to make it work again.

So this just makes it so that any attempt to open one of these specific
filenames (for reading only) always works, regardless what directory the
server is currently cd'd to.
