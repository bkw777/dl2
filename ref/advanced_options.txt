Some special features & controls, and experiments.

Aside from the options displayed by the help options -h and -l,
there are also some debugging and special options and some environment
variables.

Commandline switches:

 -^  Config dump. This just displays several config options and exits.
     If used in cencert with -vv or more, then it shows even more
     info, including the results of all environment variables.

     This is a way to verify that config options are actually in effect.

Environment variables:

To use these, just put them in the environment. The simples is just type
them on the same command line , before the executable.

Example:

	$ ROOT_LABEL=/ PARENT_LABEL=^ dl


 ROOT_LABEL    '/'  '0:'  'dlplus'  '  <>  '  'C:\'  '-root-'  etc... 

	The original Desk-Link, and so, most other emulators also,
	puts the string "ROOT  " in the top-right corner of the TS-DOS
	display when the user is in the top level share directory.

	This variable lets you put whatever you want there. If you give
	it a string shorter than 6 bytes, it will be left justified.
	If you give a string longer than 6 bytes it will be truncated.
	If you want a shorter string to be centered, just include all 6 bytes
	in the value within quotes. You can even make it blank with ''.

 PARENT_LABEL    '^'  '^:'  '______'  '-back-'  'UP:'  etc...

	Similar to ROOT_LABEL, Desk-Link used the word "PARENT" for the
	the "go back up one level" directory entry in the top-left file
	slot in the directory listing screen. This is the Desk-Link
	equivalent to ".."

	This variable lets you put whatever you want there instead of
	"PARENT", with limitations. Unfortunately, since this appears
	in the file list like any other file, TS-DOS is picky about
	what it considers a "bad" filename, and you can't put just
	anything here. Most notably, you can't use ".." :/ DAMMIT!

	This is a TS-DOS limitation. You CAN actually use "..", in that,
	dlplus will send it to TS-DOS, and TS-DOS will even display it
	properly in the file listing, but if you try to hit enter on
	it to move back up a directory, TS-DOS just beeps and says bad
	filename. TS-DOS never sends anything to the server, so the error
	is coming from TS-DOS, not from the server.

	However a lot of other things do work fine. Generally, for something
	to work, it has to be left-justified like a real filename would be.
	It takes some trial & error to figure out what works.

 ATTR     'F'   ' '   any single character

	The TPDD drive has a single-character field along with every filename.
	It's just a text field that the drive can use to return a a group of
	matching files all together before the rest during file listings.
	It's not really used by any software I know of, but the field is
	there, and Floppy always writes an 'F' there for every file. It doesn't
	really matter or do anything. Everything still works if it's blank
	for instance. But because Floppy always writes an F there, so does
	every other client and emulator.

	When an emulator is serving files, usually there is no actual attribute
	byte stored with the file, so all emulators just fabricate an F there for
	every file when they give filenames to clients.

	But a real drive doesn't care, and TS-DOS is not the only client
	that uses TPDD drives or emulators, so here is a way to modify
	that if you want.

	All this setting does is, when the client requests a file or directory
	listing, and we're sending a file name and size to the client, it uses
	this instead of 'F' for the attribute byte.

	Who/what ever cares? Who knows.

 DOT_OFFSET   0 to 25, but really only 0, 6, or 8 are useful.

	Just another way to do the same thing as the -w or -0 options.

	Default behavior is dot_offset=6 , which makes 6.2 space-padded filenames.
	The -w option for WP-2 does the same thing but 8.2
	The -0 option does dot_offset=0 plus disables all other forms of name editing or filtering.

	This variable would let you set some arbitrary value anywhere in the 0-25
	size of the field (24 plus just beyond to make another version of 0 basically)
	There is no reason to do that.

	It's possibly useful as just as an alternative way to set 0, 6, or 8 though,
	which would essentially change the default behavior instead of having to
	specify all the special options you want every time.

 OPR_MODE    0 or 1, default is 1

	A TPDD1 / FB-100 drive has two main modes of operation called
	Operation-mode and FDC-mode (actually the software manual calls
	them Operation mode and FDC-Emulation mode)

	These are basically two entire different sets of commands to
	use the drive.

	The drive is usually in Operation mode, but a few things do use FDC mode.
	You can switch the starting default state by setting this to 0.

 BAUD       9600 or 19200    19200 is default

	If for whatever reason you want to force the server to run at 9600
	instead of 19200, this how you can. Some drives like Purple Computing
	are actually hard wired to run at 9600. This would let you emulate
	one of those, perhaps for testing software against it.
